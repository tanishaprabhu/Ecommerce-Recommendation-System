Distributed AI-Driven E-Commerce Recommendation System
Overview
This project is an AI-powered hybrid product recommendation system that combines Collaborative Filtering (ALS) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow) to generate intelligent product recommendations. It processes large-scale Amazon e-commerce data using PySpark and delivers real-time recommendations through a Flask-based web application.

Features
• Hybrid recommendation engine using ALS and Deep Learning
• Distributed data processing with PySpark
• Intelligent product search and recommendations
• Displays product images, ratings, prices, reviews, and purchase links
• Real-time recommendation delivery through Flask API
• Responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Technologies Used
• Python
• PySpark
• TensorFlow
• Flask
• Pandas
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript

Project Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the Amazon e-commerce dataset using PySpark.
2. Train an ALS collaborative filtering model to generate predicted ratings.
3. Build a TensorFlow embedding model to learn user-product relationships.
4. Combine ALS and Deep Learning predictions into a hybrid recommendation score.
5. Store recommendation results in a CSV file.
6. Serve recommendations through a Flask backend API.
7. Display product recommendations on the web interface.
